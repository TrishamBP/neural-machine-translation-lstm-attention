# English-to-Portuguese Neural Machine Translation

## Project Overview
In this project, we will build an English-to-Portuguese neural machine translation (NMT) model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with an attention mechanism. Machine translation is crucial in natural language processing, enabling accurate translation of text between languages and aiding in tasks like word sense disambiguation. Implementing an encoder-decoder system with attention will address the limitations of traditional RNNs, allowing the model to handle longer sequences effectively. The model will be developed using TensorFlow and will include methods for generating translations via greedy and Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding.
